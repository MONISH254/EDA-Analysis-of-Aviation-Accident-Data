## Introduction
This notebook aims to analyze the Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023, to identify the lowest-risk aircraft for a company looking to diversify its portfolio by purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises. The goal is to provide actionable insights to the head of the new aviation division to inform their decision-making process.
## Business Understanding
### (a). Main Objective
The main objective of this project is to identify the safest airplane for the company to purchase and operate, thereby minimizing potential risks and ensuring a successful entry into the aviation industry.

### (b). Specific Objectives

The specific objectives of this project are:

(i) Data Analysis: Analyze the Aviation Accident Database & Synopses to identify the aircraft with the lowest accident rates and fatalities.

(ii) Risk Assessment: Assess the risks associated with each aircraft, considering factors such as accident rates, fatalities, and other relevant metrics.

(iii) Insight Generation: Generate actionable insights from the analysis and risk assessment to inform the head of the new aviation division's decision-making process.

## Data Understanding

The Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023 from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses), contains detailed information on aviation accidents and incidents. The dataset includes variables such as:


    - Aircraft Type: The type of aircraft involved in the accident.
    
    - Accident Date: The date of the accident.
    
    - Fatalities: The number of fatalities resulting from the accident.
    
    - Injuries: The number of injuries resulting from the accident.


By analyzing this dataset, we can gain valuable insights into the safety records of different aircraft types and make informed decisions about which aircraft to purchase and operate.
